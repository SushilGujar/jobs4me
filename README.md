Welcome to the era of AI Agents.

This program  will help you scrape the job posts across multiple job portals based on your prompt and you can sort and filter the outputs using the instructions.

To start you can download or clone the source on your machine and update the .env file with your preferred Gen AI model.
If you are like me, you would love the free API. Enjoy till it's free.
Go to https://console.groq.com/ to register and create your API Key and add the same to .env file.

To scrape the jobs, please run the jobs.py program.
I prefer uv as python package manager. Go to https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/ for the steps.

If you are using uv, run the program using following command
uv run jobs.py

Happy Job Hunting!!
